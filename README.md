# MiniML ‚Äì Machine Learning Experiment Tracking Tool

This repository contains my personal implementation of a **lightweight Machine Learning experiment tracking tool**, inspired by existing tools like **ClearML**. The goal of this project is to build a custom tool for tracking, visualizing, and comparing ML experiments, which will be used as part of my Bachelor Thesis.

## üìÑ **Project Overview**

This tool is being developed using **Flask** for the backend and **Streamlit** for the dashboard. The focus is on learning and implementing the following concepts:
- Setting up a basic Flask API for logging experiment data.
- Creating a simple dashboard using **Streamlit** to visualize experiments.
- Using **SQLite** for lightweight data storage.
- Adding real-time visualization for metrics such as Loss and Accuracy. (Planned Feature)

## üîç **Motivation**
The primary motivation for this project is to gain hands-on experience in developing a custom experiment tracking tool, which I plan to use for my Bachelor Thesis project on Machine Learning. The tool will help visualize and compare ML experiments, providing insights into hyperparameter tuning and model performance.

By working on this project, I aim to:

- Understand how to design and implement RESTful APIs with Flask.
- Learn how to visualize ML experiment data with Streamlit.
- Gain experience in integrating a backend with a frontend dashboard.
- Build a tool that can be expanded and used for future ML projects.

## üõ† **Technologies Used**

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly

## üåü **Features Implemented**

- Basic Flask API for logging experiment runs (hyperparameters, metrics).
- Streamlit dashboard for visualizing experiment data.
- SQLite database for storing experiment information.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MiniML.git
2. Install dependencies: 
    ```bash 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Start backend: 
    ```bash
    python main.py
4. Open a new terminal and run the frontend: 
    ```bash
    streamlit run frontend.py

## üîß **Work in Progress**

This project is a work in progress, and I will continue to add features.
TO-DO: Plan to deploy for live logging functionality. Currently, the tool runs locally with static data.

**Note:** This project is for educational purposes and personal development. It is part of a larger project for my Bachelor Thesis and is not intended for production use.
